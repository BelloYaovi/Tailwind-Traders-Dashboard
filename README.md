As part of a comprehensive Capstone project, I contributed to building a robust, end-to-end data analytics solution for Tailwind Traders. This project was delivered in three progressive phases, each building upon the last to transform raw data into actionable insights for business decision-makers.

Phase 1: Data Preparation and Modeling
The foundation of the project involved preparing and configuring sales data from Excel and other data sources. I ensured the data was cleansed, structured, and optimized for analysis. This phase also included designing and developing an efficient data model, establishing the groundwork for reliable reporting and analytics.

Phase 2: Insight Generation through Aggregation and Reporting
In the second phase, I focused on enhancing analytical capabilities by configuring advanced aggregations using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). I then created dynamic sales and profit reports that provided Tailwind Traders with deep insights into business performance and key metrics.

Phase 3: Executive Dashboarding and Intelligence Automation
In the final stage, I developed a user-friendly executive dashboard to centralize insights and enable data-driven decisions. To further enhance the dashboard’s utility, I configured real-time alerts and report subscriptions, ensuring stakeholders remained informed of critical changes and trends automatically.
